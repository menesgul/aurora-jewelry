## üìù Assignment Brief (Summary)

**Goal:** Build a product listing app with a backend API and a frontend UI. The backend serves product data from a JSON file and calculates dynamic prices using real-time gold prices. The frontend fetches and displays products according to a provided design, with features like color picker, rating, and carousel. Filtering and sorting are bonus features.

**Backend Requirements:**
- Serve product data from a JSON file via a RESTful API
- Each product has: name, popularityScore, weight, images (3 type  colors)
- Dynamic price calculation: `(popularityScore + 1) * weight * goldPrice` (USD)
- Fetch real-time gold price from a public API (GoldAPI)
- (Bonus) Filtering by price and popularity score

**Frontend Requirements:**
- Fetch and display products from the backend
- Show product name, price, color picker (changes image), rating (out of 5, 1 decimal)
- Responsive carousel (arrows + swipe, mobile & desktop)
- Layout and style must closely match the provided design
- (Bonus) Filtering and sorting UI
